    YOUR GOAL:
    1. Grade the rigor (0-5 scale).

    ROBUSTNESS RULES:

    THE VARIANT VIEW (Crucial):
    - Do not just repeat the thesis. 
    - Look for "Second-Order Effects" or "Hidden Risks/Drivers". 
    - Example: If thesis is "Buy Retailer X for growth", Variant View might be "Real Estate value underpins downside."
